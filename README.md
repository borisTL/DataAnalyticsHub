# [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/borisTL/DataAnalyticsHub/tree/main/Mean-Variance-Standard%20Deviation%20Calculato)

This project implements a function called `calculate()` that takes a list of 9 numbers as input and returns various statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for rows, columns, and the entire 3x3 matrix.

## Functionality
- The function accepts a list containing exactly 9 numbers.
- The input list is converted into a 3x3 NumPy array.
- The following statistical metrics are calculated:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard Deviation
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Sum
- These metrics are calculated for:
  1. Each row
  2. Each column
  3. The entire matrix (flattened).
